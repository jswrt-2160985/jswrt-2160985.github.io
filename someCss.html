        <span style="font-family:Courier"><p>This paragraph is in the font "Courier." According to Typedia, the Courier font "was designed by Howard "Bud" Kettler in 1955. The design of the original Courier typeface was commissioned in the 1950s by IBM for use in typewriters, but they did not secure legal exclusivity to the typeface and it soon became a standard font used throughout the typewriter industry."</p></span>
        <span style="font-family:Arial"><p>This paragraph is in the font "Arial." According to Neel Dozome, "Arial was designed in 1982 by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders for the type foundry Monotype. It was first packaged for the personal computer with Windows 3.1 in 1992 (along with a much more important feature: Minesweeper)."</p></span>
